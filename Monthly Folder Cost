import pandas as pd


df = pd.read_csv(r"C:\Users\rstuartii\<path_to_export>\GMC-Feb2024-raw.csv")

gmc = df[['Group Name', 'Projected Cost']]

#Drop entries that are not folder names by deleting NaNs
gmc = gmc[gmc['Group Name'].notna()]

#delete the commas in the ProjCost column
gmc['Projected Cost'] = gmc['Projected Cost'].str.replace(',', '')

#change column to numeric so it can be sorted
gmc["Projected Cost"] = pd.to_numeric(gmc["Projected Cost"])

#sort by greatest value of second column
gmc2 = gmc.sort_values(by=['Projected Cost'], ascending=False)

#now you have the folders sorted by greatest cost first.  Write to a file and modify cost column as currency in Excel
